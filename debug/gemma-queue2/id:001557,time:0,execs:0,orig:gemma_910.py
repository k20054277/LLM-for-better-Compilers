# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and round functions

# Define a number
num = 3.14159

# Use the and operator to compare two conditions
if num > 3 and num < 4:
    print("num is greater than 3 and less than 4")

# Round the number up to the nearest integer
rounded_up_num = round(num)

# Print the rounded-up number
print("Rounded-up num is:", rounded_up_num)

# Round the number down to the nearest integer
rounded_down_num = math.floor(num)

# Print the rounded-down number
print("Rounded-down num is:", rounded_down_num)
