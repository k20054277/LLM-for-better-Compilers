# This Python program demonstrates the use of None and <=

# Define a variable with a None value
x = None

# Check if the variable is less than or equal to 5
if x <= 5:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")

# Output:
# x is less than or equal to 5

# Check if the variable is not None
if x is not None:
    print("x is not None")

# Output:
# x is not None
