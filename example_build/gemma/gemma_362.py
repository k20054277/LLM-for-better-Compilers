# This Python program demonstrates the use of False and set

# Create a set
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Check if False is in the set
if False in my_set:
    print("False is in the set")

# Check if 3 is in the set
if 3 in my_set:
    print("3 is in the set")

# Print the elements of the set
print("The elements of the set are:")
for element in my_set:
    print(element)
