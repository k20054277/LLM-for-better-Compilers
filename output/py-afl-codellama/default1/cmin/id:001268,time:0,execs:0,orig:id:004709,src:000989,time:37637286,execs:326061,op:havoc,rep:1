# Example 1: Using None

print("Example 1")

# Assigning a variable to None
x = None

# Printing the value of x
print(x)

# Changing the value of x to an integer
x = 5

# Printing the value of x again
print(x)

# Changing the value of x back to None
x = None

# Printing the value of x again
print(x)


# Example 2: Garbage Collection

# Printing the values of a, b, and c
print(a)

# Printing the value of dprint(d)

# Printing the value of e

# Breaking the reference cycle by setting one of the lists to None

# Printing the values of a, b, and c again
