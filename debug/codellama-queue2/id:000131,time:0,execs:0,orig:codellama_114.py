# Demonstrate the use of 'and' and 'max' in Python

# Example 1: Using 'and' to test multiple conditions
age = 25
if age >= 18 and age <= 65:
    print("You are eligible for voting.")
else:
    print("Sorry, you are not eligible for voting.")

# Example 2: Using 'max' to find the largest of three numbers
a = 10
b = 20
c = 30
largest = max(a, b, c)
print("The largest number is", largest)
