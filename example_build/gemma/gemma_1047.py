# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and += operators

# Define a variable
x = 5

# Use the and operator to compare two conditions and execute a block of code if both conditions are true
if x > 4 and x < 7:
    print("The value of x is between 4 and 7.")

# Use the += operator to add a value to x and store the result in x
x += 2

# Print the updated value of x
print("The updated value of x is:", x)
