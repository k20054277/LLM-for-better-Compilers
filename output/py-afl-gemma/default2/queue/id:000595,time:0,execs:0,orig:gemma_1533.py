# This Python program demonstrates the use of assert and != operators

# Define a function to test
def square(x):
    return x ** 2

# Assert that square(5) is equal to 25
assert square(5) == 25

# Assert that square(4) is not equal to 25
assert square(4) != 25

# Print a message
print("The tests are complete!")
