# This Python program demonstrates the use of AND and ;

# Declare variables
a = 10
b = 20

# Use AND operator to check if a and b are greater than 10
if a > 10 and b > 10:
    print("a and b are greater than 10")

# Use ; to separate statements
print("Hello, world!")
print("Welcome to the world of Python!")
