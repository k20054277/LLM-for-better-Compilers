# This Python program demonstrates the use of AND and indentation

# Declare variables
a = 10
b = 20

# Use AND operator to check if a and b are both greater than 10
if a > 10 and b > 10:
    print("Both a and b are greater than 10")

# Indent the code inside the if statement
    print("This code is inside the if statement")

# Print a message
print("End of program")
