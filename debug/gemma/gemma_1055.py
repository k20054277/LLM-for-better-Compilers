# This Python program demonstrates the use of AND and XOR operators

# Define two variables
a = 5
b = 10

# Use AND operator to check if a and b are both greater than 5
c = a > 5 and b > 5

# Use XOR operator to check if a is greater than 5 but b is not
d = a > 5 ^ b > 5

# Print the results
print(c)  # Output: False
print(d)  # Output: True
