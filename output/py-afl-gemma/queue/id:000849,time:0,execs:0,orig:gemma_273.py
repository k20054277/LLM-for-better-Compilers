# This Python program demonstrates the use of False and None

# False is a boolean value that evaluates to False in boolean expressions
print(False)  # Output: False

# None is a special value that represents the absence of any value
print(None)  # Output: None

# False and None are not equal
print(False == None)  # Output: False

# However, they are comparable
print(False is None)  # Output: False

# You can assign None to a variable
my_variable = None

# Check if the variable is None
print(my_variable is None)  # Output: True

# You can also use the is not operator to check if the variable is not None
print(my_variable is not None)  # Output: False
