# This Python program demonstrates the use of True and >> operators

# Define a boolean variable
is_active = True

# Use True to control a conditional statement
if is_active:
    print("The system is active")

# Use True to compare two values
if is_active == True:
    print("The system is active")

# Use True to perform a logical OR operation
if is_active or False:
    print("The system is active")

# Use True to shift bits right
print(True >> 1)

# Output:
# The system is active
# The system is active
# The system is active
# 1
