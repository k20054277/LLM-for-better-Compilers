# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and () operators

# Define a function called "my_function"
def my_function(x, y):
  # Use the and operator to check if x is greater than 5 and y is less than 10
  if x > 5 and y < 10:
    # If both conditions are true, execute this code
    print("x is greater than 5 and y is less than 10")

# Define two variables, x and y
x = 7
y = 8

# Call the "my_function" function
my_function(x, y)

# Output:
# x is greater than 5 and y is less than 10
