# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and << operators

# Define a function to demonstrate the use of and and << operators
def demonstrate_operators(num1, num2):
    # Use the and operator to compare num1 and num2 for equality
    if num1 and num2 are equal:
        print("num1 and num2 are equal")

    # Use the << operator to shift num1 left by two bits
    num1_shifted = num1 << 2
    print("num1 shifted left by two bits is:", num1_shifted)

# Call the function
demonstrate_operators(5, 5)
