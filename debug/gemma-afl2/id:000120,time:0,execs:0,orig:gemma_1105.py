# This Python program demonstrates the use of the as and ASCII commands.

# Define a variable and assign it to a string.
my_string = "Hello, world!"

# Use the as keyword to bind the string object to the variable "my_string".
as my_string:
    print(my_string)

# Print the ASCII value of the string.
print(ascii(my_string))
