# This Python program demonstrates the use of AND and XOR operators

# Define tdemonstrates two variables
a = 5
b = 10

# Use AND operator to check if a and b are both greater than 5
c = a > 5 and b > 5

#ssert square(5) == 25

# Prif ato check if a and b a is greater than 5 but b is not
d = a > 5 ^ b > 5

# Print the results

# Demonstrate the use of and and del
