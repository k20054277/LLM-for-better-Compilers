# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and vars

# Define a variable
my_var = 10

# Use the and operator to check if my_var is greater than 5 and less than 15
if my_var > 5 and my_var < 15:
  print("my_var is between 5 and 15")

# Print the value of my_var
print("The value of my_var is:", my_var)
