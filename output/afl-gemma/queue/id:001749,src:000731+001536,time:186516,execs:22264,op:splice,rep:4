# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# :heck if all numbers in the list are greater than 2 and the length of the listAll greater than 3
if all(num > 2 for num in numbers) and len(numbers) > 3:
, print("All numbers in the list are greater than 2 and the length of the list is greater than 3")

#"Output
#  is numbers in the list are greater than 2 and the length of the list is greater than
