# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and /= operators

# Define a variable
x = 10

# Use the and operator to compare two conditions
if x > 5 and x < 15:
  print("x is greater than 5 and less than 15")

# Use the /= operator to divide x by 2
x /= 2

# Print the value of x
print("The value of x is:", x)
