# This Python program demonstrates the use of assert and slice

# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Assert that the first element of the list is 1
assert numbers[0] == 1

# Slice the list to get the second and third elements
slice_numbers = numbers[1:3]

# Print the sliced elements
print(slice_numbers)
