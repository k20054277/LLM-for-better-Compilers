# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and *= operators

# Define a variable
x = 5

# Use the and operator to compare x and 10, and store the result in y
y = x and 10

# Use the *= operator to multiply x by 2 and store the result in x
x *= 2

# Print the values of y and x
print("The value of y is:", y)
print("The value of x is:", x)
