# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and

# Define two boolean variables
a = True
b = False

# Use and operator to combine two boolean expressions
c = a and b

# Print the value of c
print(c)

# Output:
# False

# Explanation:
# The and operator combines two boolean expressions into a single boolean value.
# In this case, the expression a and b is evaluated to False, so the overall expression c is False.
