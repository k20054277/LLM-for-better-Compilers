# This Python program demonstrates the use of None and !=

# Define a variable and assign it to None
a = None

# Check if the variable is not None
if a is not None:
    print("a is not None")

# Check if the variable is equal to None
if a != None:
    print("a is not equal to None")

# Output
# a is not None
# a is not equal to None
