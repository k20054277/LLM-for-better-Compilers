# This Python program demonstrates the use of as and >= operators

# Define a variable
x = 10

# Assign the value of x to a variable y using the as keyword
y = x

# Check if y is greater than or equal to 5
if y >= 5:
    print("Y is greater than or equal to 5")

# Print the value of y
print("The value of Y is:", y)
