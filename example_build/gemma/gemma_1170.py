import sys

# The as keyword is used to bind a variable to an object in a context.

# Here, the variable my_as_object is bound to the sys object.
my_as_object = sys

# Now, you can use the my_as_object variable to access attributes and methods of the sys object.

# For example, you can print the sys.version attribute:
print(my_as_object.version)

# Output:
# sys.version
# Example output:
# 3.8.2
