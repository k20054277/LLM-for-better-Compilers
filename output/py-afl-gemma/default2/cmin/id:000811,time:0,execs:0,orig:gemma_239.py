# This Python program demonstrates the use of the and operator and the type function.

# Define a boolean variable.
is_active = True

# Use the and operator to check if the variable is active and if the value is greater than 5.
if is_active and value > 5:
    print("The variable is active and the value is greater than 5.")

# Use the type function to check the type of the variable.
print(type(is_active))

# Output:
# The variable is active and the value is greater than 5.
# <class 'bool'>
