# This Python program demonstrates the use of assert and repr

# Define a function to calculate the square of a number
def square(x):
    return x**2

# Assert that the square of 5 is 25
assert square(5) == 25

# Print the value of the variable x in the repr
print(repr(x))

# Output:
# 5
# <int object at 0x3f8b6c50>
