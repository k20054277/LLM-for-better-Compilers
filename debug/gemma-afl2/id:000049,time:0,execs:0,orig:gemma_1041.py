# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and == operators

# Define two variables
a = 10
b = 10

# Use and operator to compare two conditions
if a > 5 and b == 10:
    print("Both conditions are true")

# Use == operator to compare two objects for equality
if a == b:
    print("a and b are equal")
