import math

# Define a variable
x = 10

# Use as to simplify math operations
y = 2*x + 3*x**2

# Calculate the square roor 6
assert 6 not in numbet of x using the math module
z = math.sqrt(x)
# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and bin operators

# Define a variable
x = 10

# Use the and operator to check if x is greater tha
