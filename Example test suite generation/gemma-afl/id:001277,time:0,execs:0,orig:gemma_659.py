# This Python program demonstrates the use of True and max

# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Check if the number 5 is greater than 4 using True and max
if True:
    max_number = max(numbers)
    print("The maximum number in the list is:", max_number)

# Output:
# The maximum number in the list is: 10
