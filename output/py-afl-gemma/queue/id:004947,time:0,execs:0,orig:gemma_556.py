# This Python program demonstrates the use of None and ==

# Define a variable with a None value
my_none = None

# Check if the variable is None
if my_none is None:
    print("my_none is None")

# Check if the variable is equal to None
if my_none == None:
    print("my_none is equal to None")

# Output
# my_none is None
# my_none is equal to None
