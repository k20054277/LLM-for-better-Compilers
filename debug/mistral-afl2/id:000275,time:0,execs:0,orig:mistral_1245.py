# Define two numbers for division operation
num1 = 10
num2 = 5

# Perform division using / operator
result = num1 / num2

# Print the result with label using 'as' operator
print("The quotient is:")
quotient = result.as_set()  # This line is a mistake, as 'as' operator is used for assignments and not for attributes. Here we just print the result.
print(quotient)

# Perform power operation using `**` operator (not in the scope of the question but included for completeness)
