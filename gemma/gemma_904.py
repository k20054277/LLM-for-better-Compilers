# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and pow functions

# Define two numbers
num1 = 5
num2 = 3

# Use the and operator to perform a logical AND operation
result1 = num1 > 4 and num2 < 6

# Use the pow function to raise num2 to the power of num1
result2 = pow(num2, num1)

# Print the results
print("The result of the AND operation is:", result1)
print("The result of the pow function is:", result2)
