# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and

# Define a function called my_function
def my_function(a, b):
    # Check if a and b are both greater than 5
    if a > 5 and b > 5:
        # Print "Both a and b are greater than 5"
        print("Both a and b are greater than 5")

# Call the function with two arguments
my_function(6, 7)

# Output:
# Both a and b are greater than 5
