# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and * operators

# Define a function called my_function
def my_function(x, y):
    # Use the and operator to check if x and y are both greater than 5
    if x > 5 and y > 5:
        # If both conditions are true, print "Both x and y are greater than 5"
        print("Both x and y are greater than 5")

    # Use the asterisk operator to multiply x and y
    product = x * y

    # Print the product
    print("The product of x and y is:", product)

# Call the my_function function with two arguments
my_function(6, 7)

# Output:
# Both x and y are greater than 5
# The product of x and y is: 42
