# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and not operators

# Define a boolean variable
is_active = True

# Use and operator to check if is_active and another condition are true
if is_active and 5 > 3:
  print("Both conditions are true")

# Use not operator to negate the boolean variable
if not is_active:
  print("is_active is false")

# Print the value of is_active
print("The value of is_active is:", is_active)
