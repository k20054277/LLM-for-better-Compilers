# None and Constant Demonstration

# Define a constant
CONSTANT = 10

# Define a variable with None
variable_with_none = None

# Print the value of the constant
print("The value of the constant is:", CONSTANT)

# Print the value of the variable with None
print("The value of the variable with None is:", variable_with_none)

# Check if the variable with None is None
if variable_with_none is None:
    print("The variable with None is None")

# Check if the constant is equal to 10
if CONSTANT == 10:
    print("The constant is equal to 10")
