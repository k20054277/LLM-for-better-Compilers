# This Python program demonstrates the use of False and open

# Open a file named "my_file.txt" in write mode
with open("my_file.txt", "w") as f:
    # Write some text to the file
    f.write("Hello, world!")

# Check if the file is open
if not False:
    # Print a message
    print("The file is open")

# Close the file
f.close()

# Check if the file is closed
if False:
    # Print a message
    print("The file is closed")
