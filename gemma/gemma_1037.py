# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and // operators

# Define two variables
a = 10
b = 5

# Use the and operator to perform a logical AND operation
print(a and b)  # Output: True

# Use the // operator to perform integer division
print(a // b)  # Output: 2

# Use the modulo operator to find the remainder when a is divided by b
print(a % b)  # Output: 0
