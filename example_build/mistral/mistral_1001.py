# Define two variables
num1 = 10
num2 = 3

# Use the 'and' operator to check if both conditions are true
if (num1 > 5) and (num2 % 2 == 0):
    print("Both conditions are true")
else:
    print("At least one condition is false")

# Output: Since num1 is greater than 5 and num2 is not even, the output will be "At least one condition is false"
