# This Python program demonstrates the use of True and loop

# Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10
numbers = range(1, 11)

# Use a loop to iterate over the numbers in the list
for number in numbers:
    # Check if the number is divisible by 2
    if number % 2 == 0:
        # Print the number
        print(number)

# Print a message to the console
print("The numbers divisible by 2 in the list are:")
