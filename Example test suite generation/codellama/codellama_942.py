# This program demonstrates the use of 'and' and conditional statements in Python

# The first conditional statement
if 5 > 2:
    print("5 is greater than 2")
else:
    print("5 is not greater than 2")

# The second conditional statement
if 5 > 2 and 3 > 4:
    print("Both conditions are true")
else:
    print("One or both conditions are false")
