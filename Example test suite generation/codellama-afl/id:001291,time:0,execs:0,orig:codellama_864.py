# This program demonstrates the use of "and" and "help" in Python

# The "and" operator is used to combine two conditions into one. It returns true if both conditions are true, otherwise it returns false.
print("The 'and' operator:")
if 5 > 3 and 2 + 2 == 4:
    print("Both conditions are true.")
else:
    print("One or both conditions are false.")

# The "help()" function is used to display help information for a specific topic.
print("\nThe 'help()' function:")
