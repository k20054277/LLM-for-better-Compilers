# Demonstration of using False and if in Python

# The if statement can be used to check whether an expression is true or false
if 5 > 10:
    print("5 is greater than 10")
else:
    print("5 is less than or equal to 10")

# False can be used to indicate that a condition is not met
if False:
    print("This will never be executed")
