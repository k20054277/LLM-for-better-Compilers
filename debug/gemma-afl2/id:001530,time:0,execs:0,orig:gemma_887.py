# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and input.

# Get two numbers from the user.

# Check if the two numbers are less than 5.
if num1 < 5 and num2 < 5:
  print("The two numbers are less than 5.")

# Print the sum of the two numbers.
print("The sum of the two numbers is:", num1 + num2)
