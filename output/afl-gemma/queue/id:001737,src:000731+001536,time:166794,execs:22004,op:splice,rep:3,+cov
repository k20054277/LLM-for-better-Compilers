# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,if all numbers in the list are greater than 2 and the length of the list is greater than 3
if all(num > 2 for num in numbew.time)

# Print the time in rs) and len(numbers) > 3:
  print("All numbers in the list are greater than 2 and the length of the list is greater than 3")

# Output
# All numbers in the list are greater than 2 and the length of the list is greater than
