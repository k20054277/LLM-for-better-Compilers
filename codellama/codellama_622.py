# This program demonstrates the use of True and if statement in Python

# Define a variable x with value 5
x = 5

# Use the if statement to check if x is greater than 10
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")

# Use the if statement to check if x is less than or equal to 10
if x <= 10:
    print("x is less than or equal to 10")
