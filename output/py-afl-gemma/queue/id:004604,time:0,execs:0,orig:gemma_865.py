# This Python program demonstrates the use of the and operator and the chr function.

# Define a variable, x, and assign it the integer value 10.
x = 10

# Check if x is greater than 5 and less than or equal to 15.
if x > 5 and x <= 15:
    # Print "x is between 5 and 15".
    print("x is between 5 and 15")

# Convert the integer value of x into a character.
char = chr(x)

# Print the character.
print("The character corresponding to the integer value of x is:", char)
