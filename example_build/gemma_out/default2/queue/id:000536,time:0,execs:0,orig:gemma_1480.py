# This Python program demonstrates the use of assert and interpreter

# Define a function called square
def square(x):
    return x ** 2

# Assert that square(5) is equal to 25
assert square(5) == 25

# Print the value of square(5)
print(square(5))

# Output:
# 25

# The above program uses the assert keyword to verify that the square(5) function returns 25. If the assert statement fails, the program will raise an error.

# The interpreter will execute the square(5) function and check if the result is equal to 25. If it is not, the interpreter will raise an error, indicating that the assert statement has failed.
