# True and setup.py demonstration

# True module
import True

# Setup.py module
from setup.py import setup

# Use True module functions
print(True.is_prime(7))  # Output: True

# Use setup.py functions
setup()  # This will execute the setup.py script
print(True.is_prime(11))  # Output: True

# Note: The above assumes that there is a setup.py file in the same directory as the script.
# The setup.py file should define the setup function, which will execute certain tasks such as installing dependencies.
