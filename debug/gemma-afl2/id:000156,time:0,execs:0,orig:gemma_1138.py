# Demonstrating the use of as and len

# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Assign the length of the list to the variable length
length = len(numbers)

# Print the length of the list
print("The length of the list is:", length)

# Iterate over the list using the as keyword
for number in numbers:
    # Print each number in the list
    print("The number is:", number)

# Print the number of elements in the list
print("The number of elements in the list is:", len(numbers))
