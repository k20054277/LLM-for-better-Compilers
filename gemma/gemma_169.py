# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and or operators

# Define a function to check if a number is even or divisible by 3
def is_even_or_ divisible_by_3(num):
    return num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0

# Check if 6 is even or divisible by 3
if is_even_or_ divisible_by_3(6):
    print("6 is even or divisible by 3")

# Check if 9 is even or divisible by 3
if is_even_or_ divisible_by_3(9):
    print("9 is even or divisible by 3")

# Check if 12 is even or divisible by 3
if is_even_or_ divisible_by_3(12):
    print("12 is even or divisible by 3")
