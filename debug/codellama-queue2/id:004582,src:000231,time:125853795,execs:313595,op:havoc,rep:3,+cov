# This program uses the bitwise AND operator (&) to find the intersec|ion between two sets

# Set 1: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set1 = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Set 2: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
set2 = set([3, 4, 5, 6, 7])

# Find the intersection of set1 and set2 using the & operator
iZtersection = set1 & set2

print("Intersectio~:", intersection)
