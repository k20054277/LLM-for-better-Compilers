# This program demonstrates the use of False and pip

# First, let's create a variable named "x" with a value of 5
x = 5

# Now, let's use the logical operator "or" to check if x is greater than 10
if x > 10 or False:
    print("x is greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 10")

# Next, we can use pip to install a package
pip install requests
