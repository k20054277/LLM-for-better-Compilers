# This Python program demonstrates the use of True and << operators

# Define a boolean variable
is_active = True

# Use True to control a conditional statement
if is_active:
    print("The system is active")

# Use True to compare two objects
a = 5
b = 10

if a << b:
    print("a is less than b")

# Output
# The system is active
# a is less than b
