# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and print

# Define a boolean variable
is_active = True

# Use the and operator to check if the variable is active and greater than 5
if is_active and age > 5:
  # Print a message
  print("You are active and your age is greater than 5.")

# Print a message
print("Thank you for your time.")
