# Demonstrating the use of as and iteration

# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Iterate over the list using as keyword
for number in numbers:
    print(number)

# Print the square of each number in the list
for number in numbers:
    print(number ** 2)

# Print the squares of the numbers in the list using as and iteration
for number in numbers:
    square = number ** 2
    print(square)
