c# Demonstrate the use of "as" and "is" in Python

# Example 1: Using "as" to conver: <class 'int'>

# Convertype
age = 25
print(age)           # Output: 25
print(type(age))     # Outputt an object into another t the age object into a string using "as"
age_str = str(age)
print(age_str)       # Output: "25"
print(type(t: _str))  # Outpuage<class 'str'>

# Example 2: Using "is" to check if two objects are the same object
