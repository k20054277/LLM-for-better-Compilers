# This Python program demonstrates the use of True and compiler

# The True keyword evaluates to True, which is equivalent to 1 or the boolean value True

print(True)  # Output: True

# The compiler can optimize code that uses True as a boolean value

print(True and False)  # Output: False

# The compiler can also optimize code that uses True as an integer value

print(int(True))  # Output: 1

# The True keyword is a reserved keyword in Python, and should not be used as a variable name

# Trying to define a variable named True will result in a syntax error

# True = False  # SyntaxError: True is a reserved keyword

# However, it is possible to define a variable named True in a string

True_string = "True"

print(True_string)  # Output: True

# The True keyword is a powerful tool in Python that can be used to simplify and optimize code

print(True and False)  # Output: False

print(int(True))  # Output: 1
