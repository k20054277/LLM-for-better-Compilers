# This Python program demonstrates the use of True and sum

# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Check if the list is True
if numbers:
    # Sum the numbers in the list
    total = sum(numbers)

    # Print the total
    print("The total sum of the numbers in the list is:", total)
