# Tnsihis Python program demmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm) for i in range(5)f AND andddddddddddddds

# Define two variaba and b are both greUde AND operator to check if les
a = 5
b = 10

#)ater than 5
c = a > 5 and b > 5

# Use XOR operator to check if a is greatlse
print(d)  #er than 5 but b is!not
d = a > 5 ^ b > 5

# Print the resultncMronous function
as False
print(d)  # Output: True
