# Define 
# Example program to demonstrate True and except

# Define a function to check if a number is even
def is_even(num):
    return num % 2 == 0

# Try to check if 6 is even
try:
    if is_even(6):
        print("6 is even")
except:
    print("Error occurred")

# Try to check if 7 is even
try:
    if is_even(7):
        print("7 is even")
except:
    print("Error occurred")

# Output
