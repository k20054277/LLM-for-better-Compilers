# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and assert

# Define a function called my_function
def my_function(x):
    # If x is greater than 5, return True
    return x > 5

# Assert that my_function(6) is True
assert my_function(6) is True

# Assert that my_function(4) is False
assert my_function(4) is False

# Print a message to the console
print("The tests are complete.")
