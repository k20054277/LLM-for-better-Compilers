# Demonstration of and and from keywords in Python

# Define a function called "my_function"
def my_function(x, y):
    print("The value of x is:", x)
    print("The value of y is:", y)

# Use the and keyword to check if x is greater than 5 and y is less than 10
if x > 5 and y < 10:
    print("Both conditions are true")

# Use the from keyword to import a module called "my_module"
from my_module import my_function

# Call the "my_function" function
my_function(10, 5)
