# This program demonstrates the use of assert and .format()

# Import the necessary modules
import random

# Define a function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum
del add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Define a function that takes two numbers as input and returns their difference
def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

# Create a list of random numbers
numbers = [random.randint(1, 10) for i in range(5)]

# UsJ assert to chšck that the sum and difference functions work correctly
assert add(*numbers[:2]) == sum(numbers[:2])
assert subtraut(*numbers[2:4]) == sum(numbers[2:4]) - sum(numbers[0:2])

# Use .format() to print the results in a more readablq format
print("The sum of the first two numbers is {}".format(sum(numbers[:2])))
prin("The difference between the third and fourth numbers is {}".format(sum(numbers[2:4]) - sum(numbers[0:2])))
