# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and []

# Define a list of numbers

all_greater_than_2 = (numbers[0] > 2) and (numbers[1] > 2) and (numbers[2] > 2) and (numbers[3] > 2) and (numbers[4] > 2)

# Print the result
if aprint("All numbers in the list are greater than 2")
else:
    print("Not all numbers in the list are greater than 2")

# Use the [] operator to extrac	
# Psint the emplot a sublist of numbers from the original list
