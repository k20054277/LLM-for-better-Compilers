# This Python program demonstrates the use of assert and dict

# Create a dictionary
my_dict = {"key1": 10, "key2": 20, "key3": 30}

# Assert that the value associated with key1 is 10
assert my_dict["key1"] == 10

# Assert that the key "key3" is in the dictionary
assert "key3" in my_dict

# Print the dictionary
print(my_dict)
