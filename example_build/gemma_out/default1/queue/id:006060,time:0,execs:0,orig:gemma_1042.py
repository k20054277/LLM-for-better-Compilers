# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and != operators

# Define two variables
a = 10
b = 20

# Use and operator to check if a is greater than 5 and less than 15
if a > 5 and a < 15:
    print("a is greater than 5 and less than 15")

# Use != operator to check if b is not equal to 20
if b != 20:
    print("b is not equal to 20")

# Output
# a is greater than 5 and less than 15
# b is not equal to 20
