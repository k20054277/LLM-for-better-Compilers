# This Python program demonstrates the use of assert and >

# Define a function to test
def square(x):
    return x ** 2

# Assert that square(5) is equal to 25
assert square(5) == 25

# Assert that square(2) is less than or equal to 4
assert square(2) <= 4

# Print the results
print("The tests have been successful!")
