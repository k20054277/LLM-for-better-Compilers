# None and the empty string are two common ways to represent the absence of a value
# in Python.

# None represents the absence of any value
a = None

# The empty string represents the absence of a value, but it can also be used to store
# an empty list or dictionary
b = ""

# Print a and b
print(a)
print(b)

# You can also use None and the empty string to check if a variable is None or empty
# If a variable is None or the empty string, it will return True
print(a is None or b == "")
