# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and eval

# Define a variable
x = 5

# Use the and operator to check if x is greater than 4 and less than 7
if x > 4 and x < 7:
    print("x is greater than 4 and less than 7")

# Use the eval function to evaluate the expression "x + 2"
y = eval("x + 2")

# Print the value of y
print("The value of y is:", y)
