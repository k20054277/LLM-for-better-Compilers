# This Python program demonstrates the use of False and object

# Define an object
my_object = object()

# Check if the object is False
if my_object is False:
    print("my_object is False")

# Check if the object is not False
if my_object is not False:
    print("my_object is not False")

# Check if the object is True
if my_object is True:
    print("my_object is True")

# Output
# my_object is False
# my_object is not False
# my_object is not True
