# This Python program demonstrates the use of as and round

# Define a number
num = 10.5

# Use as to assign a alias to the num variable
as x = num

# Round the number down to the nearest integer
rounded_down = int(x)

# Round the number up to the nearest integer
rounded_up = int(x) + 1

# Print the results
print("The value of num is:", num)
print("The value of x is:", x)
print("Rounded down to the nearest integer is:", rounded_down)
print("Rounded up to the nearest integer is:", rounded_up)
