# This Python program demonstrates the use of None and None in comparison

# Define a function that returns None
def my_function():
    return None

# Define a variable and assign it to None
my_variable = None

# Check if the variable is None
if my_variable is None:
    print("my_variable is None")

# Compare the variable to None using ==
if my_variable == None:
    print("my_variable is None")

# Compare the variable to None using is
if my_variable is None:
    print("my_variable is None")

# Print the value of the variable
print("The value of my_variable is:", my_variable)
