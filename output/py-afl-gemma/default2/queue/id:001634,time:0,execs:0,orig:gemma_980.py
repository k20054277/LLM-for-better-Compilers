# This Python program demonstrates the use of AND and loop

# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Use a loop to iterate over the list and check if each number is greater than 2 and less than 5
for number in numbers:
    if number > 2 and number < 5:
        print(number)

# Output:
# 3
# 4
