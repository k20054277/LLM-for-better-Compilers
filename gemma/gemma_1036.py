# This Python program demonstrates the use of AND and / operators

# Define two variables
a = 10
b = 20

# Use AND operator to check if a and b are both greater than 10
if a > 10 and b > 10:
    print("Both a and b are greater than 10")

# Use / operator to divide a by b
c = a / b

# Print the value of c
print("The value of c is:", c)
