# This Python program demonstrates the use of the and operator and the compiler

# Define a function called "my_function"
def my_function(a, b):
    # Use the and operator to check if a and b are both greater than 5
    if a > 5 and b > 5:
        # If both conditions are true, print "Both a and b are greater than 5"
        print("Both a and b are greater than 5")

# Call the "my_function" function with two arguments
my_function(6, 7)

# Output:
# Both a and b are greater than 5
