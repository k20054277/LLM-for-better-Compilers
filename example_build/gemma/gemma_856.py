# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and abs functions

# Define a number
num = 5

# Check if num is greater than 3 and less than 7
if num > 3 and num < 7:
    print("num is greater than 3 and less than 7")

# Calculate the absolute value of num
abs_num = abs(num)

# Print the absolute value of num
print("The absolute value of num is:", abs_num)
