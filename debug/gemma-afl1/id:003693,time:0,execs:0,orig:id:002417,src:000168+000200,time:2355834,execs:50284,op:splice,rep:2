# This Python program demonstrates the use of as and ord functions

# Define a character
char = "A"

# Use as to assign the ASCII value of the character
import re

# Define a string
string = "This is a string with a few words. The string has a few special characters, including $,#, and %. It also has some numbers, such as 12 and 34."

# Use as and re to find all words in the string
words = re.findall(r"\w+", string)
print(words)

# Use as and re to find all numbers in the stringnumbers = re.findall(r"[0-9]+", string
