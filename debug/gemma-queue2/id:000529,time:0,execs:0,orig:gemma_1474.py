# This Python program demonstrates the use of assert and comment

# Define a function called square
def square(x):
    return x ** 2

# Assert that square(5) is equal to 25
assert square(5) == 25

# Print the result
print("The square of 5 is:", square(5))

# Comment out the following line as it is not related to the main purpose of the program
# print("This line is commented out")
