# This Python program demonstrates the use of as and oct.

# Define a variable
num = 12

# Use as to assign a alias to the variable
as_num = num

# Print the value of num using the alias
print(as_num)

# Convert the integer num to an octal integer
oct_num = oct(num)

# Print the octal value of num
print(oct_num)
