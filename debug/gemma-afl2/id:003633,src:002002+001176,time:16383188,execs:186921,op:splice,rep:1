# Demonsm bitwise AND operations. It is

# None

a = None
print(a)  # Output: None

# &. Operator

b = 10 & 5
print(b)  # Output: 0

# Combining None and &. Operator

c = None & 10
print(c)  # Output: None

# Explanation

# None represents the absence of any value. It is used to indicate that a variable has not been assigned a value yet.

# The &. operator is used to perfortrating the use of None and '&' used to compare two binary numbers bit-by-bit and set the bits to 0 if they are both 1.

# The combination of None and the &. operator results in None because there is no integer value that can be ANDed with
