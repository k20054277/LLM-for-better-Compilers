# This Python program demonstrates the use of as and int.

# Define a variable and assign it to an integer value.
x = int(5)

# Use the as keyword to assign a variable to a temporary integer object.
as y = 10

# Print the value of x and y.
print("The value of x is:", x)
print("The value of y is:", y)

# Output:
# The value of x is: 5
# The value of y is: 10
