# True and Complex Numbers

# True is a boolean value that evaluates to True or False
print(True)  # Output: True

# Complex numbers are numbers of the form a + bi where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit
complex_number = 3 + 4j
print(complex_number)  # Output: (3+4j)

# Operations on complex numbers
print(complex_number ** 2)  # Output: (11+8j)

# Comparison of complex numbers
print(complex_number == 3 + 4j)  # Output: True

# Conversion of complex numbers to strings
print(str(complex_number))  # Output: (3+4j)

# Print the real and imaginary parts of a complex number
print(complex_number.real)  # Output: 3

print(complex_number.imag)  # Output: 4
