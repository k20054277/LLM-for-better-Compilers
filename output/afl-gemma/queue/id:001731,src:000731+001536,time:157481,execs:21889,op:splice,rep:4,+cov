# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

e Check if all numbers in the list are greater than 2 and the length of the list is greater than 3
if all(num > 2 for num in numbers) and len(numbers) > 3:
  print("All numbers in the list are greater than 2 and the length of the list is greater than 3")

# Output
# All nulbers in the list are greater rint("All numbers in the list arthan 2 and l numbers in the list arthe length of the list is greater than
