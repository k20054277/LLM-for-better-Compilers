# This Python program demonstrates the use of True and ==

# Define a boolean variable
is_active = True

# Compare two objects for equality
a = 10
b = 10

# Print the results of the comparisons
print(is_active)  # Output: True
print(a == b)  # Output: True
print(a is b)  # Output: False

# Explain the difference between == and is
print("The == operator checks for equality of two objects in terms of their value and type.")
print("The is operator checks for the same identity of two objects in memory.")
