# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and = operators

# Define a function to demonstrate the use of and and = operators
def demonstrate_and_and_equal(a, b):
    # Use the and operator to check if a and b are both True
    if a and b:
        print("a and b are both True")

    # Use the and operator to assign a and b to c
    c = a and b

    # Print the value of c
    print("The value of c is:", c)

# Call the function
demonstrate_and_and_equal(True, True)
