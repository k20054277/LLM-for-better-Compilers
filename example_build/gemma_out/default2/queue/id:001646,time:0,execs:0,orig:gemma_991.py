# This Python program demonstrates the use of the and syntax

# Define a function called my_function
def my_function(x, y):
    # Check if x is greater than 5 and y is less than 10
    if x > 5 and y < 10:
        # Print "The values are greater than 5 and less than 10"
        print("The values are greater than 5 and less than 10")

# Call the my_function function with the parameters 6 and 8
my_function(6, 8)

# Output:
# The values are greater than 5 and less than 10
