# This Python program demonstrates the use of True and debugging

# Define a function called my_function
def my_function(x):
    # Check if x is greater than 5 using the boolean operator True
    if x > 5:
        print("x is greater than 5")
    # Otherwise, print "x is less than or equal to 5"
    else:
        print("x is less than or equal to 5")

# Call the my_function function with different values
my_function(6)
my_function(2)

# Check if the function is working correctly by printing the value of x
print(x)

# Debug the program by printing the value of x inside the function
print("The value of x inside the function is:", x)
