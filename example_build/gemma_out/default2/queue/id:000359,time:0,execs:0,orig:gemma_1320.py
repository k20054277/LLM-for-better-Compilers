# This Python program demonstrates the use of assert and break statements

def divide(x, y):
    # Assert that y is not equal to 0, otherwise raise an error
    assert y != 0
    return x / y

# Attempt to divide by 0, which will raise an assert error
divide(10, 0)

# If the assert error is raised, the program will break out of the function
# and print the error message
print("Error: division by 0 is not allowed")

# Otherwise, the function will return the result of the division
print(divide(10, 2))
