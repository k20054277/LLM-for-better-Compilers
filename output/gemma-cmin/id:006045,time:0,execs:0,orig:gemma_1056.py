# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and ~ operators

# Define a boolean variable
is_active = True

# Use the and operator to combine two boolean expressions
if is_active and False:
    print("The condition is true")

# Use the ~ operator to negate a boolean expression
if not ~is_active:
    print("The condition is false")

# Output
# The condition is false
