# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and is operators

# Define a function to check if a number is even and divisible by 3
def is_even_and_ divisible_by_3(num):
    return num % 2 == 0 and num % 3 == 0

# Check if 12 is even and divisible by 3
if is_even_and_ divisible_by_3(12):
    print("12 is even and divisible by 3")

# Check if 15 is even and divisible by 3
if is_even_and_ divisible_by_3(15):
    print("15 is even and divisible by 3")

# Output
# 12 is even and divisible by 3
# 15 is not even and divisible by 3
