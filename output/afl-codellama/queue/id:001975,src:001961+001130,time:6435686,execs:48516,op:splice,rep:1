# This program demonstrates the use of as and zip

# Create a list of names

# Use zip to crimport tensorflow as tf

# Create a constant tensor containing the value 5

# Create a variable tensor containing the value 10

# Create a placeholder tensor to be filled with a value at runtime
placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=())

# Use the `True` keyword to create a boolean tensor that is always true

# Use the `False` keyword to create a booleantensor that is always false
