# Demonstrating the use of False and semantics in Python

# Create a variable x with a value of True
x = True

# Print the value of x
print(x) # Output: True

# Change the value of x to False using the assignment operator
x = False

# Print the value of x again
print(x) # Output: False

# Use the not operator on x to negate its value
y = not x

# Print the value of y
print(y) # Output: True

# Use the and operator to combine x with a boolean literal
z = x and True

# Print the value of z
print(z) # Output: False

# Use the or operator to combine x with a boolean literal
w = x or True

# Print the value of w
print(w) # Output: True
