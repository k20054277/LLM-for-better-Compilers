# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and eval

# Define a variable
x = 10

# Use the and operator to check if x is greater than 5 and less than 15
if x > 5 and x < 15:
    print("x is greater than 5 and less than 15")

# Use the eval function to evaluate the expression "x + 5"
y = eval("x + 5")

# Print the value of y
print("The value of y is:", y)
