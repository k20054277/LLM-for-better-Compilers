# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and not operators

# Define a function to check if a number is even and divisible by 3
def is_even_and_ divisible_by_3(num):
  return num % 2 == 0 and num % 3 == 0

# Check if 12 is even and divisible by 3
if is_even_and_ divisible_by_3(12):
  print("12 is even and divisible by 3")

# Check if 15 is even and divisible by 3
if is_even_and_ divisible_by_3(15):
  print("15 is even and divisible by 3")

# Check if 18 is even and divisible by 3
if is_even_and_ divisible_by_3(18):
  print("18 is even and divisible by 3")

# Check if 21 is even and divisible by 3
if is_even_and_ divisible_by_3(21):
  print("21 is even and divisible by 3")
