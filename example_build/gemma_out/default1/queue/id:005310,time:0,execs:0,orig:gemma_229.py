# This Python program demonstrates the use of the and and round functions

# Define a number
num = 5.2

# Use the and operator to compare two conditions
if num > 5 and num < 10:
    print("num is greater than 5 and less than 10")

# Round the number up to the nearest integer
rounded_up_num = math.ceil(num)

# Print the rounded-up number
print("Rounded-up num is:", rounded_up_num)

# Round the number down to the nearest integer
rounded_down_num = math.floor(num)

# Print the rounded-down number
print("Rounded-down num is:", rounded_down_num)
