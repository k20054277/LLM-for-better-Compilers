# False and Tuple demonstration

# Define a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, False)

# Print the elements of the tuple
print("The elements of the tuple are:")
for element in my_tuple:
    print(element)

# Check if the tuple element is False
if my_tuple[3] is False:
    print("The third element in the tuple is False")

# Output
# The elements of the tuple are:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# False
# The third element in the tuple is False
