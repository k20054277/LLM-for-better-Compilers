# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and >> operators

# Define a variable
x = 10

# Use the and operator to compare two conditions
if x > 5 and x < 15:
    print("x is greater than 5 and less than 15")

# Use the >> operator to shift x right by 2 bits
y = x >> 2

# Print the value of y
print("The value of y is:", y)
