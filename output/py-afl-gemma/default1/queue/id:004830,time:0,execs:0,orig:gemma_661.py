# This Python program demonstrates the use of True and min

# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Check if the number 5 is greater than 3 using True and min
if True:
    print(min(numbers))

# Output:
# 1

# The above program prints the minimum value of the numbers list, which is 1.
