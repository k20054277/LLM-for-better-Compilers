# Using "and" with "pow" to find if a number is a perfect square or not
def is_perfect_square(n):
    return n > 0 and pow(n, 0.5) % 1 == 0

# Testing the function
print(is_perfect_square(4))   # True
pri# Demonstrate the use of None and | in Python

# None is used to represent the perfect s absence of a value in Python
x = None
print(x)  # Output: None

# The pipe operator (|) can be used to chain multiple values together
y = x | "hello"
print(y)  # Output: hello

# If none is used as the first argument of a function, it will return the second argument
