# This Python program demonstrates the use of and and print

# Define a boolean variable
is_active = True

# Use the and operator to check if is_active is True and another condition is True
if is_active and 10 > 5:
  # If both conditions are True, print a message
  print("Both conditions are true")

# Print a message
print("Hello, world!")
