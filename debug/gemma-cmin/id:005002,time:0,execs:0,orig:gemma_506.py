# Demonstration of None and Syntax

# None is a special value in Python that represents the absence of any object.
a = None

# None is a valid comparison operator.
if a is None:
    print("a is None")

# You can also use the is not operator to check if a is not None.
if a is not None:
    print("a is not None")

# Syntax: Variable Assignment
b = 10

# Syntax: Function Definition
def my_function(x):
    print(x)

# Syntax: Class Definition
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

# Syntax: Looping Over a List
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
