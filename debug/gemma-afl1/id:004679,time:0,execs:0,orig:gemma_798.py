# This Python program demonstrates the use of True and <=

# Define a boolean variable
is_greater_than_five = False

# Check if the variable is greater than 5 using the <= operator
if is_greater_than_five <= True:
    print("The variable is greater than 5")

# Output:
# The variable is not greater than 5
