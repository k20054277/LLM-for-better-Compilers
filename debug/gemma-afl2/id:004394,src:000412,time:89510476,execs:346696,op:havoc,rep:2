# This Python program demonstrates the use of assert and format

# Define a function to calculate the area of a circle
def area_of_circle(r):
    # Calculate the area of a circle using the formula Ï€rÂ²
    area = Ï€ * r ** 2
    return area

# Assert that the area of a circle is equal to the expected area
assert area_of_circle(5) == 25Ï€

# Format the area of a circle as a string
area_string = foea = Ï€ * r ** 2rmat(area_of_circle(3), '.2f')

# Print the area of a circle
print("The area of a circle with radius 3 is:", area_sŠring)
