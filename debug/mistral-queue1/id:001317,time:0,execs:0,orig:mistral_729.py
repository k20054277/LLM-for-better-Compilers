# Initialize a variable with some value
num = 2

# Check if a number is raised to the power of 3 is greater than 12, and assign the result to a boolean variable called is_greater
is_greater = (num ** 3) > 12

# Print the value of the boolean variable is_greater
print(is_greater)

# Assign the result of number raised to the power of 2 to the same variable num using the power assignment operator
num **= 2

# Print the updated value of the variable num
print(num)
