# This is a simple Python script demonstrating the usage of 'and' operator

# Define some variables
x = 5
y = 10
z = 2

# Check if x is less than y and y is greater than z using 'and' operator
result = (x < y) and (y > z)

# Print the result with an explanatory comment
if result:
    print("x is less than y AND y is greater than z")
else:
    print("x is not less than y OR y is not greater than z")
